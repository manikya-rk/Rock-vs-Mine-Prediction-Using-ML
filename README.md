#  Rock vs Mine Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict whether an object is a **Rock** or a **Mine** based on sonar signal data. The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+(sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks)).
